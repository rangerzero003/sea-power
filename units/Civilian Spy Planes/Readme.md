# Civilian Spy Planes

This mod modifies the vanilla Civilian Light Twin Prop aircraft and Small Bizjet aircraft to contain advanced optical and passive radar sensors, for when you need a less conspicuous recon aircraft over unfriendly territory. This mod only adds sensors, and does not modify any other stats for the two aircraft.

## New Units

Both are located under the Civilian Category
- Light Twin (Recon)
- Small Bizjet (Recon)

## New Sensors

Recon Camera
- Can look in a full 360 degree circle below the aircraft

Tail Camera
- Can look in a 180 degree half circle below and behind the aircraft

IR Sight
- Can look in a full 360 degree cirlce below the aircraft

Radar Warning Receiver
- Will alert if the aircraft is being targetted

Aircraft ELINT
- Passively detects active radar

Aircraft ECM
- Electronic Countermeasures to improve survivability

## Notes

Both planes are marked with `Role=Spy` which should report them as the normal civilian versions of the aircraft and as a neutral, but this system is currently finicky and if a unit gets too close, it will just mark them as an enemy. This is just how the game works, and not much can be done currently. If you want to see a vanilla example, use the USSRs Okean to see how the Spy role works.
